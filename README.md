# identify-dog-breeds

Using Python, I determined which image classification algorithm works the best on classifying images as "dogs" or "not dogs".
* determined how well the "best" classification algorithm works on correctly identifying a dog's breed.
* timed how long each algorithm takes to solve the classification problem. 

I worked with a pre-trained image classifier and used my Python skills to compare the CNN Model Architectures.
